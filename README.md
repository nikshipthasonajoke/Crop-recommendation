# Crop-recommendation
The Crop Recommendation Flask Web App is a web application designed to suggest the optimal crop for cultivation based on soil and climate conditions. This project involves developing a machine learning model that can predict the best crop choice by analyzing various factors like soil pH, temperature, rainfall, humidity, and crop type. The model is integrated into a Flask web application, offering farmers a user-friendly tool to aid in effective crop selection.
